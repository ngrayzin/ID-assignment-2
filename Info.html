              Each year, it's estimated that more than one million adoptable dogs and cats are euthanized, simply because too many pets come into shelters and too few people consider adoption when looking for a pet.
              The number of euthanized animals could be reduced dramatically if more people adopted pets instead of buying them. When you adopt, you save a loving animal by making them part of your family and open up shelter space for another animal who might desperately need it.
              Our goal is to help all these pets get their well deserved home and to make everyone happier.

              Overburdened shelters take in millions of stray, abused and lost animals every year, and by adopting an animal, you’re making room for others. Not only are you giving more animals a second chance, but the cost of your adoption goes directly towards helping those shelters better care for the animals they take in!
              You would also get a new best friend out of the deal. Seriously, what could be better than that?

              Many people are usually confused whether they should adopt or buy a dog. These are some questions to ask yourself:<br>
              
              <b>1. Do I want a shelter or rescue dog?</b>
              It’s easy to get confused, but there’s a difference between shelter dogs and rescue dogs. While animal shelters (like the Humane Society) house surrendered pets or street dogs, rescue groups generally take in specific dog breeds, friendly dogs from shelters with high euthanasia rates, or pups with specific medical needs. At a shelter, you can easily see all the dogs during your visit but the staff may not have as much information about their temperament.

              Meanwhile, rescues house their pooches in foster homes first. This means you can learn more about them before adopting. This is ideal if you have other pets or want to adopt a specific breed without supporting puppy mills.
              <br>
              <b>2. What breed or type of dog is the right dog for me?</b>
              Being honest about whether or not you want a specific breed can help you choose between shelter dogs and rescue pups. It can also stop you from becoming overwhelmed with options.

              Consider whether the energy level and size of your preferred breed fits in with your lifestyle, too. Let’s be honest, adopting a Great Dane if you live in a city apartment isn’t a great idea, but a smaller, older dog could be a great fit.
              <br>
              <b>3. Can I afford to adopt a dog?</b>
              Dogs don’t come cheap! Before heading to the pound and going googly-eyed over a potential ‘furever’ friend, sit down and do some math. Once you factor in the pet care essentials (food, toys, dog training, kennel costs, dog adoption fees, and vaccinations), you’re looking at spending over $2000 a year on your dog. Not to mention emergency vet fees, which can cost up to $1500 a year, as well as replacing anything they accidentally destroy. This can range from a cheap pair of socks to a pricey sofa. 
              <br>
              <b>4. Do I have the time and ability to care for a dog?</b>
              Do you have a busy job or a hectic family life? Do you have the time to give a dog the attention — including daily walks, socialization, and playtime — that it needs? Dogs can be a handful, and you probably shouldn’t adopt if you don’t think you have the time to care for one. You may even need to make time for training classes, as well as regular veterinary care visits.

              The following questions will help you learn if your cat is a good fit for both your family and the cat's wellbeing if you were to adopt.<br>
              <b>1. Is the Cat Litter Trained?</b>
              Knowing whether or not your prospective cat is litter trained will save you from any unwanted surprises when you arrive home with him. If he isn’t trained you’ll need to decide if you feel equipped to train him yourself.

              While it may not be a deal-breaker if the cat isn’t litter trained, you may want to delay bringing him home until you’ve taken the time to create a litter training plan.
              <br>
              <b>2. What is the Cat’s Temperament?</b>
              If you’re visiting a cat in a shelter setting it can be tough to get an idea of what his true temperament. Meeting new people is stressful for many cats, plus the chaos and commotion of a shelter or animal rescue can put even the most relaxed cat on edge.

              Ask the shelter volunteers what their impression of the cat is. In most cases, they will have spent some one on one time with him and can give you more insight into the cat’s personality. Again, shelters are stressful places for animals and it’s more than likely that the cat will not reveal his true self until he is settled into your home. 
              <br>
              <b>3. Why Was the Cat Surrendered?</b>
              Knowing why a cat was surrendered may help you anticipate any potential problems that may arise when integrating him into your family and home. Pets are re-homed for all kinds of complex reasons, so try to stay objective when faced with the response. 

              For instance, if a cat was rehoused for scratching furniture, it doesn’t mean he’s a bad cat. However, you should evaluate whether you’re prepared to invest the time and energy in correcting this behavior.
              <br>
              <b>4. Has the Cat Been Vaccinated?</b>
              It’s essential to ensure your new cat receives his vaccinations to protect against illnesses. Many times, rescue organizations have pets vaccinated before adopting them out, but it’s always wise to double-check. While rescues usually ensure pets have received their core vaccinations, you may wish to have your cat vaccinated against additional illnesses. 

              If your prospective cat requires vaccinations you will need to factor the expense into your cat adoption budget.

              We put together a list of common adoption myths, in the hopes that you can gently point friends toward this post when they talk about adding a pet to their family.
              <br>
              <b>Myth #1: I don’t know what I’m getting</b>
              There may in fact be more information available about an adoptable pet than one from a breeder or pet store.

              Many of the pets posted on Petfinder are in foster care. Foster parents live with their charges 24-7 and can often tell you, in detail, about the pet’s personality and habits. If the pet is at a shelter, the staff or volunteers may be able to tell you what he or she is like.

              At the very least, you can ask the staff if the pet was an owner surrender (rather than a stray) and, if so, what the former owner said about him or her. Quite often pets are given up because the owner faced financial or housing issues (more on that later). You can also ask about the health and behavioral evaluations the pet has undergone since arriving at the shelter. In contrast, pet store owners rarely have an idea of what a pet will be like in a home.
              <br><b>Myth #2:  I can get a free pet, so why pay an adoption fee?</b>
              According to the National Council on Pet Population Study and Policy (via the ASPCA), approximately 65% of pet parents in the U.S. get their pets for free or at low cost, and most pets are obtained from acquaintances or family members. The NCPPSP also reports that pets acquired from friends make up more than 30% of pets surrendered to shelters (read the article here).

              While getting a “free” pet may seem like a bargain at first, you’re then responsible for veterinary costs that shelters and rescue groups usually cover, including:
              <ul style = "font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif;font-size: 15px;">
                <li>Spaying/neutering $150-300</li>
                <li>Distemper vaccination $20-30 x2</li>
                <li>Rabies vaccination $15-25</li>
                <li>Heartworm test $15-35</li>
